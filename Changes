1.20

* Fixed: since normal(), bold(), underline() and reverse() are
  considered to be 'termcap' sequences (as opposed to ANSI color
  sequences) and are therefore immune to colorizability, so also
  putcolor(), colored() and color2esc(), called with each of these
  names, should make no difference for colorizability.
* Restructured code.

1.19

* Fixed tests: flash() is not available everywhere

1.18

* Fixed test: on OpenBSD, normal() may return "\e(B\e[m"

1.17

* Deprecated support for static calls to color(), putcolor(), colored()
  and putcolored(). This was never correctly supported anyway, and this
  fixes some bugs.
* Added tests for color(), putcolor(), colored() and putcolored().

1.16

* Workaround for OpenSolaris 11 bug. It has no termcap database and
  "infocmp -C" does not provide the properties 'normal', 'bold' and
  'reverse' (even though "infocmp" does). Therefore, Term::Cap cannot
  provide these properties.  In that case, fall back on terminfo and
  cache the results.
* Added flash2esc()

1.15

* Fixed bug: color2esc('') now returns empty string instead of \e[m

1.14

* Fixed tests: normal() may also return \e[m\017
* Fixed Makefile.PL: dependency on Term::Cap was missing

1.13a

* Fixed tests: flash() is not available everywhere; normal()
  may return \e[m instead of \e[0m.

1.13

* Fixed bug in Term::Screen where partial function key escape
  sequences were added to the wrong end of the input buffer.
* Added flash() to send visual bell
* Changed raw() and cooked(): they no longer call echo() and
  noecho().

1.12

* Added bold2esc(), reverse2esc(), underline2esc(), normal2esc()
* Changed: underline() can no longer be turned off with
  colorizable(); underscore() can.

1.11

* Fixed bug in Term::Screen where getch() would cause keypresses
  to become hidden from the application (replaced getc() with
  sysread()).
* Added timeout so that Escape does not have to be pressed twice.
* Added raw() and cooked() for convenience.
