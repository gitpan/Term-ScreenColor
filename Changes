1.16

* Workaround for OpenSolaris 11 bug. It has no termcap database and
  "infocmp -C" does not provide the properties 'normal', 'bold' and
  'reverse' (even though "infocmp" does). Therefore, Term::Cap cannot
  provide these properties.  In that case, fall back on terminfo and
  cache the results.
* Added flash2esc()

1.15

* Fixed bug: color2esc('') now returns empty string instead of \e[m

1.14

* Fixed tests: normal() may also return \e[m\017
* Fixed Makefile.PL: dependency on Term::Cap was missing

1.13a

* Fixed tests: flash() is not available everywhere; normal()
  may return \e[m instead of \e[0m.

1.13

* Fixed bug in Term::Screen where partial function key escape
  sequences were added to the wrong end of the input buffer.
* Added flash() to send visual bell
* Changed raw() and cooked(): they no longer call echo() and
  noecho().

1.12

* Added bold2esc(), reverse2esc(), underline2esc(), normal2esc()
* Changed: underline() can no longer be turned off with
  colorizable(); underscore() can.

1.11

* Fixed bug in Term::Screen where getch() would cause keypresses
  to become hidden from the application (replaced getc() with
  sysread()).
* Added timeout so that Escape does not have to be pressed twice.
* Added raw() and cooked() for convenience.
